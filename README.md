# How to run this app on Expo development build mode?
In your Windows PC, right-click on your preferred folder's File Explorer window and Open terminal in that folder. Then enter the command: <br/>
`git clone "https://github.com/solomonirailoa/react-native-demo-001.git"`
<br/> using the Terminal or Command Prompt. 

This creates a directory named `react-native-demo-001`.

Now change to that director by entering the command `cd react-native-demo-001`, and then enter the command `npm install`.
