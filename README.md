# FBC App demo 
This is our FBC app made with the React-Native framework. <br/>

# How to run this app on Expo development build mode?
In your Windows PC, right-click on your preferred folder's File Explorer window and Open terminal in that folder.

Then enter the command: <br/>
`git clone "https://github.com/solomonirailoa/react-native-demo-001.git"`
<br/> using the Terminal or Command Prompt. This will take a while. Wait for when it's done.

This creates a directory named `react-native-demo-001`.

Now change to that directory by entering the command `cd react-native-demo-001`, and then enter the command `npm install`. This will also take a while. Wait once it's complete. 

Next you'll need to install this ".apk" file at the given link: https://expo.dev/accounts/fijian-broadcasting-corporation/projects/react-native-demo-001/builds/05e5fdc0-93e1-4cd5-8de5-9f1b93eed57d , into your Android device. 

Once you've installed the custom Expo client above in your Android device, you will then enter the following command in your PC: `npx expo start`.

Metro builder should be starting up, and then you are introduced to the Expo's message in develpoment build mode alongside a QR code for you to scan with your phone. Make sure your PC and your Android device are both connected to the same Wi-Fi network. 

The live preview of the app can be done by opening "FBC app" in your Android device, and then entering the URL manually, or you can let the client search for development builds automatically in the same network. Alternatively, you can use your QR code Scanner in your phone to scan the QR code in your PC's terminal (when initially running `npx expo start`). This allows the "FBC app" to connect to the Expo development build running in your PC, sync changes, and gives you a live preview of the app.

If you have issues running this project or installing modules, try running `npx react-native doctor` to fix errors. This command lists down a list of tools and programs needed properly to run react-native projects. Hope you have Java JDK and Android Studio installed. Optionally, you might need to run `npm upgrade` to update NodeJS modules which may be outdated.
